# Serocatalytic models

Fitting serocatalytic models to seroepidemiology data.

This repository contains targets workflows for fitting models to published serology data to infer dynamics of natural infection. 
The serocatalytic models estimate (i) age dependent FOI, (ii) time dependent FOI, (iii) combined age and time dependent FOI; and account for (iv) maternal antibody decay, (v) and elevated death rates due to infection.
